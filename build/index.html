<p>Solar Flight is currently in the final stage of construction of a new airplane for the Sunseeker family: Sunseeker Duo. The goal is to build an airplane using the best available technologies to achieve the maximum possible performance without using fossil fuels. Not only will the Duo be the fastest solar-powered airplane ever built; it will be the first solar powered airplane to offer a seat for passengers. The Duo incorporates all of the best features of the other Sunseeker aircraft and adds many refinements, not to mention significantly improved technologies. The solar cells used by the Duo are better than 50% more efficient than those used by Sunseeker II. While Sunseeker II is able to cruise in level flight on direct solar power, the Duo will have enough power to maintain a steady climb on direct solar power. The tricycle landing gear arrangement, familiar to all pilots, ensures that the Duo will operate normally at any airport in the world and folding wings give the airplane a hanger footprint no larger than a Cessna 172. The airplane can also be quickly disassembled and packed into a custom trailer.



</p>
<p>The Sunseeker Duo realizes Solar Flightâ€™s dream of a practical, high performance, 2-place solar powered airplane. With the US and Western Europe already well explored by Sunseekers I and II, Solar Flight is looking towards the dramatic landscapes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia for possible expeditions with the new airplane. Whether it is a day of local flying above the clouds, or a trans-continental adventure, Solar Flight is a new paradigm for aviation: adventure, freed from the constraints of fossil fuels.

            <section class="content clearfix"><p>Today we assembled the major components of Sunseeker Duo out on the ramp for the first time. There is a lot of work left to do, but it is encouraging to see the ship start to look like an airplane! Compared to the original Sunseekers, the Duo is a giant. The switchblade function of the wings reduce its footprint to a managable size for hangar storage.

            </header>
            <section class="content clearfix"><p>The Sunseeker Duo is truly an international effort.  Consider that the fuselage was  molded at Allstar Gliders in Poland. With extensive support from Germany and Slovenia, the project is  gathering momentum. Construction moves ahead, with high quality parts as the rule.

</p>
<p>Here we introduce the engineering effort on the nose gear from our friends in Santa Paula, California.

</p>
<p>The nose gear is a crucial assembly, requiring shock absorbtion, steering, and retraction, all in a reliable light weight package. Rick McWilliams (<a href="http://www.tangentinstruments.com/">http://www.tangentinstruments.com/</a>) designed the trouble free nose gear for the Mermaid amphibian, so he got the job of designing our nose gear under very demanding weight and space constraints.



</p>
<p>Partnered with him is John Lynch, whose shop is also at the Santa Paula Airport, to turn the computer files into parts.  While most of the parts of the new plane are composite, this assembly will utilize aluminium. The shock absorber is integrated co-axially into the strut to save weight.  A carbon pre-preg fork will be tested with the assembly, attaching to the nylon wheel.

<p>After a successful hang gliding career and constructing several of his own gliders Eric Raymond was invited by Rochelt to fly his human powered airplane, Musculair II. Musculair II was groundbreaking in its simplicity and to this day remains the fastest human powered aircraft ever built. With Rochelt&apos;s encouragement, Raymond conceptualized the original Sunseeker. The configuration was based on that of Musculair II and Rochelt passed on the novel construction techniques that he used to acheive phenomonally lightweight, yet robust structures.

</p>
<p>In addition to the serious of human-powered airplanes, Rochelt built two significant solar-powered ships.
Solair 1 was based on a Hans Farner canard design. It employed 2499 wing-mounted solar cells giving an output of between 1.8 and 2.2 kW. The aircraft first flew at UnterwÃ¶ssen, Germany on 21 August 1983. It flew for 5 hours and 41 minutes. The airplane is now displayed at the German Museum in Munich  Rochelt&apos;s second solar-powered airplane, Solair II, made its first flight in May 1998 and further test flights that summer, but the propulsion system overheated too fast and development stopped when GÃ¼nther Rochelt suddenly died in September 1998. More information about Rochelt&apos;s many projects can be found at <a href="http://www.solair.de">solair.de</a>


</p>
<p>Solar Flight&apos;s efforts are dedicated to the memory of Professor GÃ¼nther Rochelt.

<p>Solar flight was established to further the development of solar powered and electric sport aircraft. Eric Raymond&apos;s dream of solar powered flight began in 1979, when Larry Mauro demonstrated his solar powered ultralight glider, named Solar Riser. 1981&apos;s debut of Paul MacCready&apos;s Solar Challenger added credibility to the concept. The revelation, after flying GÃ¼nther Rocheltâ€™s Muculair II, that a fast, streamlined aircraft could be built for incredibly low weight was the impetus that led to the construction of the Sunseeker. Design of Sunseeker I began in 1986. Progress was slow until 1988, when support was found in Japan. With the help of several corporate sponsors. Sunseeker I was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider. 

</p>
<p>In early 1990 battery powered flights were made with two brush motors driving a variable pitch prop, which could be feathered for gliding. The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory, so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed.

<p>Solar Flightâ€™s first airplane, Sunseeker I, was designed for a mission to cross America, a feat it accomplished during the summer of 1990. The expedition began in the Southern California desert and with 21 flights ended in a field near the site where the Wright Brothers first flew. It was the first time that a solar-powered airplane crossed the United States, and the first demonstration of a practical solar-powered sport airplane.

<p>The Edelweiss was the second airplane produced by Solar Flight. It was built in response to a debate as to whether it was possible to construct a high performance sailplane that weighed less than the ultralight category weight limit of 154 pounds. AlthoughSunseeker I was initially flown as a glider with an empty weight of only 100 lbs, it was considered too fragile to be practical. More durability was built into the Edelweiss, with less wing span for better maneuverability and a higher top speed. It is designed for a top speed of 120 knots and is fully aerobatic. One of its design features is the inclusion of water ballast tanks in the wings, capable of carrying 150 lbs of water. The wings were load tested to 6.6 g before flight testing.

<p>In 2006 many improvements to the original Sunseeker were completed. The new airplane, dubbed Sunseeker II, featured a redesigned wing with more area for solar cells, a more powerful motor, new lithium polymer batteries, and an updated electrical system. In 2009, again with Eric Raymond in the cockpit, Sunseeker II completed a vast flying tour of Europe. The tour began with the first crossing of the Alps every made by a solar powered airplane and continued down the length of Italy to Sicily, followed by a route along the Dolomites through Austria and Slovenia, and finally a journey through the South of France and Spain ending at Spainâ€™s southern coast.

<p>Sunseeker I and II have logged, by a huge margin, more flight hours than any other solar powered airplane. The Sunseeker, unlike other solar powered aircraft that have been flown in ideal conditions under strict ground supervision, is the only solar powered aircraft to have been tested and proven in continuous real world operations.

<p>99 years after the first crossing of the Alps in an airplane by Geo ChÃ¡vez flying a BlÃ©riot XI, Eric Raymond completed the first crossing of the Alps made by a solar-powered airplane flying Sunseeker II.

</p>
<p>&quot;It was one of the most difficult things that I have ever done, but it was also the most beautiful flight I have ever made. It was very cloudy, but after fighting to gain altitude I got over the clouds and cruised on direct solar power, eventually climbing to 13,700 ft. It was amazing to see the peaks of the mountains coming upthrough the clouds. I could clearly see the Matterhorn and Mt Blanc over the clouds. I could not see anything in the direction of Italy, except a solid wall of clouds. I tried to climb over them on course for Torino, but I had to fly between towering cumulo-nimbus clouds. I was in bright sun, when I noticed that I was flying through large snowflakes. That was the first sign of trouble. Soon I was trapped over these rising clouds, with my escape closed off. I was climbing at full power, but the clouds were rising faster. It was snowing on me, even though I was in the sun! Desperately flying around in my shrinking trap I found a small hole, where I could see the ground. Just snow and trees. I turned off the motor, set the airbrakes, and spiraled down 7000 ft, until I was just under the clouds. I wanted to take a picture of the snow, but I couldnâ€™t take my hands from the controls. After feeling desperate about flying through clouds in a blinding snowstorm, I felt much better seeing that the clouds did not go all the way to the ground. I even flew with a sailplane and a paraglider, so I did not feel so alone. Because of the thunderstorms, I left the Alps early, and had a long crossing over the Italian flats. It seemed to take forever to get to Torino, but in reality the entire flight took less than 5.5 hours. TV crews were waiting, and we saw the story on the national news that night in our hotel, just before a nice dinner with our hosts, the organizers of the World Air Games 2009. We are now preparing to continue down the length of Italy, to Sicily.&quot;

            <section class="content clearfix"><p>Eric Raymond&apos;s career in flying began at an early age, with model airplanes. Working with Paul Mac Cready, he flew the MPA Bionic Bat.   He was invited to fly Gunther Rochelt&apos;s human powered Musculair 2 and with Rochelt&apos;s help he formulated the concept for the Sunseeker. The Sunseeker went on to break all previous records for solar powered aircraft. Raymond studied aeronautical engineering at University of California San Diego. From 2003 - 2007 he worked with AeroVironment on classified projects building unmanned aircraft for the U.S. military.
