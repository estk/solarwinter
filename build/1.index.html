          <h2>2013.05.03 - Godspeed, Bertrand!</h2>
          <article><p><img class="img-sl" src="/news/solarimpulsebrad.jpg"> 23 years after the first solar-powered airplane crossing of the United States made by Eric Raymond flying Sunseeker I, Solar Impulse has launched its own expedition. Bertrand Piccard took off early this morning from Moffett field in California with Phoenix, Az set as his goal. A fitting first leg, Phoenix was also the first destination for Sunseeker I on its journey across America. Performance can be pursued in many forms and the metric that Solar Impulse is after is duration. Using energy stored both in batteries and in the altitude that is gained during the day, HB-SIA is able to glide and cruise at low power through the night. Though it flies at similar airspeeds as Sunseeker I, HB-SIA is able to plan much longer flights because of its incredible duration. 23 years is a long time in the tech world – batteries, solar cell and materials have all improved, but with structural, aerodynamic, and UV requirements all at odds with each other, designing a solar-powered airplane remains no small challenge. Solar Impulse licensed Solar Flight Inc’s solar-cell integration technology and hired Eric Raymond to oversee HB-SIA’s construction.</p>
<p>As we wish Andre and Bertrand favorable winds on their adventure, we prepare our new airplane, Sunseeker Duo for its maiden flight in Italy.</p>

          <article class="intro"><p>Solar Flight is preparing to test fly a new airplane in the Sunseeker family: Sunseeker Duo. The goal is to acheive maximum performance without using fossil fuels. Not only will the Duo be the fastest solar-powered airplane ever built; it will be the first solar powered airplane to offer a seat for passengers. The Duo incorporates all of the best features of the other Sunseeker aircraft and adds many refinements, not to mention significantly improved technologies. The solar cells used by the Duo are better than 50% more efficient than those used by Sunseeker II. While Sunseeker II is able to cruise in level flight on direct solar power, the Duo will have enough power to maintain a steady climb on direct solar power. The tricycle landing gear arrangement, familiar to all pilots, ensures that the Duo will operate normally at any airport in the world and folding wings give the airplane a hanger footprint no larger than a Cessna 172. The airplane can also be quickly disassembled and packed into a custom trailer.</p>
<p>The Sunseeker Duo realizes Solar Flight’s dream of a practical, high performance, 2-place solar powered airplane. With the US and Western Europe already well explored by Sunseekers I and II, Solar Flight is looking towards the dramatic landscapes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia for possible expeditions with the new airplane. Whether it is a day of local flying above the clouds, or a trans-continental adventure, Solar Flight is a new paradigm for aviation: adventure, freed from the constraints of fossil fuels.</p>

            <section class="content clearfix"><p>The Sunseeker Duo is truly an international effort.  Consider that the fuselage was  molded at Allstar Gliders in Poland. With extensive support from Germany and Slovenia, the project is  gathering momentum. Construction moves ahead, with high quality parts as the rule.</p>
<p>Here we introduce the engineering effort on the nose gear from our friends in Santa Paula, California.</p>

</a>

</div>

<p>The nose gear is a crucial assembly, requiring shock absorbtion, steering, and retraction, all in a reliable light weight package. Rick McWilliams (<a href="http://www.tangentinstruments.com/">http://www.tangentinstruments.com/</a>) designed the trouble free nose gear for the Mermaid amphibian, so he got the job of designing our nose gear under very demanding weight and space constraints.</p>
<p>Partnered with him is John Lynch, whose shop is also at the Santa Paula Airport, to turn the computer files into parts.  While most of the parts of the new plane are composite, this assembly will utilize aluminium. The shock absorber is integrated co-axially into the strut to save weight.  A carbon pre-preg fork will be tested with the assembly, attaching to the nylon wheel.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>With south winds here in Slovenia, we have the chance for mountain waves.  I flew around for almost four hours finding nothing, even though there were lenticulars overhead.  I even motored us to 12,000 ft, looking for wave lift.  I finally gave up and headed out over the airport, but then I found wave lift right over the runway.  With 32 knots of wind showing on my GPS, I slowly crabbed over to Triglav Mountain, while climbing to over 15,000 ft.  It is a strange feeling to be downwind of such big mountains in such strong wind, but it was perfectly smooth. </p>

<p>After a successful hang gliding career and constructing several of his own gliders Eric Raymond was invited by Rochelt to fly his human powered airplane, Musculair II. Musculair II was groundbreaking in its simplicity and to this day remains the fastest human powered aircraft ever built. With Rochelt&#39;s encouragement, Raymond conceptualized the original Sunseeker. The configuration was based on that of Musculair II and Rochelt passed on the novel construction techniques that he used to acheive phenomonally lightweight, yet robust structures.</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to the series of human-powered airplanes, Rochelt built two significant solar-powered ships.
Solair 1 was based on a Hans Farner canard design. It employed 2499 wing-mounted solar cells giving an output of between 1.8 and 2.2 kW. The aircraft first flew at Unterwössen, Germany on 21 August 1983. It flew for 5 hours and 41 minutes. The airplane is now displayed at the German Museum in Munich  Rochelt&#39;s second solar-powered airplane, Solair II, made its first flight in May 1998 and further test flights that summer, but the propulsion system overheated too fast and development stopped when Günther Rochelt suddenly died in September 1998. More information about Rochelt&#39;s many projects can be found at <a href="http://www.solair.de">solair.de</a></p>
<p>Solar Flight&#39;s efforts are dedicated to the memory of Professor Günther Rochelt.</p>

<p>Solar flight was established to further the development of solar powered and electric sport aircraft. Eric Raymond&#39;s dream of solar powered flight began in 1979, when Larry Mauro demonstrated his solar powered ultralight glider, named Solar Riser. 1981&#39;s debut of Paul MacCready&#39;s Solar Challenger added credibility to the concept. The revelation, after flying Günther Rochelt’s Muculair II, that a fast, streamlined aircraft could be built for incredibly low weight was the impetus that led to the construction of the Sunseeker. Design of Sunseeker I began in 1986. Progress was slow until 1988, when support was found in Japan. With the help of several corporate sponsors. Sunseeker I was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider. </p>
<p>In early 1990 battery powered flights were made with two brush motors driving a variable pitch prop, which could be feathered for gliding. The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory, so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed. </p>

</div>

<p>Solar Flight’s first airplane, Sunseeker I, was designed for a mission to cross America, a feat it accomplished during the summer of 1990. The expedition began in the Southern California desert and with 21 flights ended in a field near the site where the Wright Brothers first flew. </p>
<p>&quot;With average conditions, I could cross about one state per day, with the first landing being just northeast of Phoenix AZ, after an 8 hour flight. </p>
<p>At my slow flying speed, I often flew in formation with flocks of birds.  Nearing the Appalachian Mountains, I flew with the same three black birds two days in a row. They were still following me when I reached the highest part of the mountain range that I needed to cross.  I decided the safest thing to do was to fly up through the clouds, so I could fly over the tops of all the clouds and mountains.</p>
<p>I switched on my simple blind flying instruments, but even with my head down, I noticed the three black birds, hovering just above and to the sides of my window.  The thicker the cloud, the closer they stayed, but they never left, until we were in the clear again.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Raymond</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the first crossing of the United States made by a solar-powered airplane; an affirmation of the technology&#39;s potential and a milestone in aviation history.</p>

<p>The Edelweiss was the second airplane produced by Solar Flight. It was built in response to a debate as to whether it was possible to construct a high performance sailplane that weighed less than the ultralight category weight limit of 154 pounds. AlthoughSunseeker I was initially flown as a glider with an empty weight of only 100 lbs, it was considered too fragile to be practical. More durability was built into the Edelweiss, with less wing span for better maneuverability and a higher top speed. It is designed for a top speed of 120 knots and is fully aerobatic. One of its design features is the inclusion of water ballast tanks in the wings, capable of carrying 150 lbs of water. The wings were load tested to 6.6 g before flight testing.</p>

<p>In 2006 many improvements to the original Sunseeker were completed. The new airplane, dubbed Sunseeker II, featured a redesigned wing with more area for solar cells, a more powerful motor, new lithium polymer batteries, and an updated electrical system. In 2009, again with Eric Raymond in the cockpit, Sunseeker II completed a vast flying tour of Europe. The tour began with the first crossing of the Alps ever made by a solar powered airplane and continued down the length of Italy to Sicily, followed by a route along the Dolomites through Austria and Slovenia, and finally a journey through the South of France and Spain ending at Spain’s southern coast.</p>
<p>Sunseeker I and II have logged, by a huge margin, more flight hours than any other solar powered airplane. The Sunseeker, unlike other solar powered aircraft that have been flown in ideal conditions under strict ground supervision, is the only solar powered aircraft to have been tested and proven in continuous real world operations. </p>

<p>99 years after the first crossing of the Alps in an airplane by Geo Chávez flying a Blériot XI, Eric Raymond completed the first crossing of the Alps made by a solar-powered airplane flying Sunseeker II.</p>
<p>&quot;It was one of the most difficult things that I have ever done, but it was also the most beautiful flight I have ever made. It was very cloudy, but after fighting to gain altitude I got over the clouds and cruised on direct solar power, eventually climbing to 13,700 ft. It was amazing to see the peaks of the mountains coming upthrough the clouds. I could clearly see the Matterhorn and Mt Blanc over the clouds. I could not see anything in the direction of Italy, except a solid wall of clouds. I tried to climb over them on course for Torino, but I had to fly between towering cumulo-nimbus clouds. I was in bright sun, when I noticed that I was flying through large snowflakes. That was the first sign of trouble. Soon I was trapped over these rising clouds, with my escape closed off. I was climbing at full power, but the clouds were rising faster. It was snowing on me, even though I was in the sun! Desperately flying around in my shrinking trap I found a small hole, where I could see the ground. Just snow and trees. I turned off the motor, set the airbrakes, and spiraled down 7000 ft, until I was just under the clouds. I wanted to take a picture of the snow, but I couldn’t take my hands from the controls. After feeling desperate about flying through clouds in a blinding snowstorm, I felt much better seeing that the clouds did not go all the way to the ground. I even flew with a sailplane and a paraglider, so I did not feel so alone. Because of the thunderstorms, I left the Alps early, and had a long crossing over the Italian flats. It seemed to take forever to get to Torino, but in reality the entire flight took less than 5.5 hours. TV crews were waiting, and we saw the story on the national news that night in our hotel, just before a nice dinner with our hosts, the organizers of the World Air Games 2009. We are now preparing to continue down the length of Italy, to Sicily.&quot;</p>
