<p>&quot;He was our greatest inspiration, and we miss him very much.&quot; 

</p>
<p>Solar Flight&apos;s efforts are dedicated to the memory of Professor Günther Rochelt.

</p>
<p>After a prolific hang gliding career and constructing several of his own gliders, Eric Raymond was invited to fly the two fastest pedal powered aircraft in the world; AeroVironment&apos;s Bionic Bat and Günther Rochelt&apos;s Musculair II. The Musculair II, built by Günther Rochelt, was groundbreaking in its simplicity and to this day remains the fastest human powered aircraft ever built. The experience flying Rochelt’s Musculair II was pivotal in Raymond&apos;s career. The revelation that a fast, streamlined aircraft could be built at an incredibly low weight, if the correct materials and engineering were employed, was the impetus that led to the construction of the Sunseeker. More information about Rochelt&apos;s many projects can be found at solair.de. 
</p>
<h1>Sunseeker I</h1>
<p>Solar Flight began the design and construction of Sunseeker I in 1986. The progress was slow until 1988, when support was found in Japan. With the help of several corporate sponsors. Sunseeker I was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider. In early 1990 battery powered flights were made with two brush motors driving a variable pitch prop, which could be feathered for gliding. The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory, so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed. 
</p>
<h2>Crossing the United States</h2>
<h1>Edelweiss</h1>
<p>The Edelweiss was the second airplane produced by Solar Flight. It was built in response to a debate as to whether it was possible to construct a high performance sailplane that weighed less than the ultralight category weight limit of 154 pounds. AlthoughSunseeker I was initially flown as a glider with an empty weight of only 100 lbs, it was considered too fragile to be practical. More durability was built into the Edelweiss, with less wing span for better maneuverability and a higher top speed. It is designed for a top speed of 120 knots and is fully aerobatic. One of its design features is the inclusion of water ballast tanks in the wings, capable of carrying 150 lbs of water. The wings were load tested to 6.6 g before flight testing.

</p>
<h1>Sunseeker II</h1>
<p>After successfully crossing the United States in Sunseeker I, a long series of modifications and refinements led to an almost entirely new airplane. In 2002 a new wing was constructed with a different plan form, more surface area for solar cell coverage, and a new technique for integrating the latest generation of solar cells into the actual wing structure rather than bonding them to the surface. The new aircraft features a unique teetering propeller, which drastically reduces vibration. In 2006, a new motor was constructed for the airplane that is twice as powerful as Sunseeker I&apos;s motor. An improved tail was fitted to the aircraft in addition to a new set of control electronics designed by Alan Cocconi for the batteries and solar arrays. The new electronics greatly increase the system&apos;s efficiency. As a final touch, the new aircraft is fitted with four packs of advanced lithium polymer batteries, which find their home in the wings of the airplane.

</p>
<h2>Europern Tour</h2>
<p>In 2009, again with Eric Raymond in the cockpit, Sunseeker II completed a vast flying tour of Europe. The tour began with the first crossing of the Alps every made by a solar powered airplane and continued down the length of Italy to Sicily, followed by a route along the Dolomites through Austria and Slovenia, and finally a journey through the South of France and Spain ending at Spain’s southern coast.
