title: Flight Log

Adventure is inevitable when you fly experimental aircraft. Solar Flight's solar-powered airplanes have logged more time than the combined total of every other solar-airplane in the world. The Sunseeker family has flown in seven countries, crossed mountain ranges, deserts, and continents, faced wind, rain and snow, and set speed, distance, altitude, and duration records many times. But the Sunseeker aircraft are designed to do more than set records and accomplish feats â€“ they are designed to be practical sport machines. Long quiet days in the mountains, in the bright sun above the clouds, with an open canopy and unlimited free energy.
