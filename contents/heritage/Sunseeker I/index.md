Solar flight was established to further the development of solar powered and electric sport aircraft. Eric Raymond's dream of solar powered flight began in 1979, when Larry Mauro demonstrated his solar powered ultralight glider, named Solar Riser. 1981's debut of Paul MacCready's Solar Challenger added credibility to the concept. The revelation, after flying Günther Rochelt’s Muculair II, that a fast, streamlined aircraft could be built for incredibly low weight was the impetus that led to the construction of the Sunseeker. Design of Sunseeker I began in 1986. Progress was slow until 1988, when support was found in Japan. With the help of several corporate sponsors. Sunseeker I was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider. 

In early 1990 battery powered flights were made with two brush motors driving a variable pitch prop, which could be feathered for gliding. The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory, so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed.

Solar Flight’s first airplane, Sunseeker I, was designed for a mission to cross America, a feat it accomplished during the summer of 1990. The expedition began in the Southern California desert and with 21 flights ended in a field near the site where the Wright Brothers first flew. It was the first time that a solar-powered airplane crossed the United States, and the first demonstration of a practical solar-powered sport airplane.
