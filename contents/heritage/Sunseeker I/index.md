Solar flight was established to further the development of solar powered and electric sport aircraft. Eric Raymond's dream of solar powered flight began in 1979, when Larry Mauro demonstrated his solar powered ultralight glider, named Solar Riser. 1981's debut of Paul MacCready's Solar Challenger added credibility to the concept. The revelation, after flying Günther Rochelt’s Muculair II, that a fast, streamlined aircraft could be built for incredibly low weight was the impetus that led to the construction of the Sunseeker. Design of Sunseeker I began in 1986. Progress was slow until 1988, when support was found in Japan. With the help of several corporate sponsors. Sunseeker I was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider. 


In early 1990 battery powered flights were made with two brush motors driving a variable pitch prop, which could be feathered for gliding. The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory, so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed.

Solar Flight’s first airplane, Sunseeker I, was designed for a mission to cross America, a feat it accomplished during the summer of 1990. The expedition began in the Southern California desert and with 21 flights ended in a field near the site where the Wright Brothers first flew. 

"With average conditions, I could cross about one state per day, with the first landing being just northeast of Phoenix AZ, after an 8 hour flight. 

At my slow flying speed, I often flew in formation with flocks of birds.  Nearing the Appalachian Mountains, I flew with the same three black birds two days in a row. They were still following me when I reached the highest part of the mountain range that I needed to cross.  I decided the safest thing to do was to fly up through the clouds, so I could fly over the tops of all the clouds and mountains.

I switched on my simple blind flying instruments, but even with my head down, I noticed the three black birds, hovering just above and to the sides of my window.  The thicker the cloud, the closer they stayed, but they never left, until we were in the clear again."

- Eric Raymond

It was the first crossing of the United States made by a solar-powered airplane; an affirmation of the technology's potential and a milestone in aviation history.
