We are proud to announce that the Sunseeker Duo was honored at this year's <a href="http://www.berblinger.ulm.de/html/winners2013">Berblinger Competition</a>. The Prize this year is shared by three deserving endeavors.

"The jury – made up of representatives from the aviation and space industry, universities and research institutes, and from the City of Ulm – has nominated the following three people/teams for the Berblinger Competition 2013:

Stefan Senger from Holzheim with his “Hybrid/Range-Extender for a Glider with Electric Power System”.

Eric and Irena Raymond from Ramona (California, USA) with their “Sunseeker Duo”, a refinement of the Sunseeker II project, which won the Berblinger Flight Competition in 2011.

Björn Drees from Ostelsheim with his “Ultralight Canard Aircraft in Power Glider Configuration”, which also involves a “Range Extender” with an electric power system."
