It is the first day of a National glider contest being held here in Voghera, I took off late, and never saw the crowd until they were coming back.

I headed 20 miles south, to the mountains and a perfect cloudstreet. Once I reached cloudbase, I started the motor and climbed up to 13,000 ft, visiting the towering clouds. The last one was huge, but before I got to it I hit heavy sink and then severe turbulence.  It felt like I would be flipped over, so I did my best to get pointed away from the cloud, and on my way home.  Very soon it was perfectly smooth again, and I had 12,000 feet to burn off in only 20 miles, so I flew fast, up to 70 mph.
 
I tried a few zooms, and decided there was no reason not to do a loop, so I did one. That makes the Sunseeker II the first aerobatic solar powered airplane. No problem at all.
