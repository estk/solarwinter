 The campaign to build the fuselage was completed at the Allstar Glider factory in southern Poland. Andrej Papiorek, the owner. helped us with materials and construction techniques, not to mention full use of his well equipped workshop.

Many parts, and the molds themselves are provided by Stemme GmbH. The window is from Mecaplex in Switzerland, and was installed by experts in Poland, a tricky job!

The fuselage is molded from carbon fiber, with 100% Nomex honeycomb sandwich.

Roman Susnik brings to our attention the housing for the new motor he is developing.
