Today the European division of Airtech Advanced Materials Group in Luxembourg announced that they will support Solar Flight's effort to develop new solar powered aircraft.  AirTech Europe supplies the continent with the best vacuum bagging and composite tooling supplies available to the aerospace industry.

These quality material are crucial for the production of the new SUNSEEKER DUO wings, as they are being made from pre-pregs, to resist the high temperatures generated by the solar cells.
