Today we assembled the major components of Sunseeker Duo out on the ramp for the first time. There is a lot of work left to do, but it is encouraging to see the ship start to look like an airplane! Compared to the original Sunseekers, the Duo is a giant. The switchblade function of the wings reduce its footprint to a managable size for hangar storage.
