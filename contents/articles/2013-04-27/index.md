This week we brought the Sunseeker Duo to AERO Friedrichshafen for its public unveiling. The airplane is fresh out of the paint shop, and since it is too large to fully assemble in the Slovenian workshop, it is also the first time that we got to see the airplane in its full glory!

AERO is always a special event, a convergence of the best sport aviation manufactures and many interesting projects in development, this year was especially good. Not only do we have a new airplane to show - we were treated to the central display space at the main entrance.
