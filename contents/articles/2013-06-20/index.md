At daybreak at our test facility in Voghera, Sunseeker Duo was pulled out from its hanger and onto the runway for its maiden flights. The airplane was connected to a tow vehicle, driven by Irena Raymond. On the first run, Eric kept the airplane on the ground for a high speed taxi test. The airplane handled well, so on the second pass Eric pulled the nose wheel off the ground, the wings flexed to life and with little fuss the Duo climbed into the sky.

A total of seven flights were made. After the first few flights, ballast bags were added to mimic the weight that will be added when the battery packs are incorporated. Eric reported that the handling improved considerably as the weight increased. The flights confirmed that the airframe, control systems, and landing gear are rigged correctly and the airplane handles as predicted both in the air and on the ground.
