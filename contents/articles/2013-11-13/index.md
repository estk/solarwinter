The sky was full of lennies already at dawn, so about 1:30 in the afternoon I took off and headed south, which is downwind.  I concentrated on climbing as high as possible, until my batteries were used up.  I gained 4500 ft climbing in calm air, running the motor.  The wind rose to only 11 knots at 5000 ft, but still I did not want to get too far downwind from home.  I calculated in my head that I could venture out only 14 nautical miles, which was exactly correct, another half mile and it would have been a tough trip home!

That took me under the first big wave cloud, but it was much higher, and there was no wave at my altitude.  My fast glide home was almost a straight in approach to land!  I had about 400 ft extra and I would have never found the airport at that low angle without the GPS.  Everything around here looks the same, and it was a bit hazy.
