Sunseeker Duo is the newest addition to the Sunseeker Family. The goal continues to be to build a sport airplane utlizing the best available technologies to achieve the maximum possible performance - without using fossil fuels, of course. Not only will the Duo be the highest performing Sunseeker ever built, it will be the first solar powered airplane to offer a seat for passengers. The solar cells used by the Duo are better than 50% more efficient than those used by Sunseeker II. While Sunseeker II is able to cruise in level flight on direct solar power, the Duo will have enough power to maintain a steady climb on direct solar power. Sunseeker Duo is designed for adventures. The tricycle landing gear arrangement, familiar to all pilots, ensures that the Duo will operate normally at any airport in the world and folding wings give the airplane a hanger footprint no larger than a Cessna 172.
