Today was crystal clear, with no clouds at all, so I was tempted away from work for a few hours to go flying. I could see the new snow on the Alps, but I headed south as usual. The air was completely smooth, with no sign of thermals, so I decided to see how high I could climb on the battery and solar power. I was climbing "against" the sun, which was a disadvantage. I was able to climb just over 5,200 ft over the airport. Not bad for this time of year.

Cumulus clouds started to form over the Apennine, so I decided to continue flying in that direction, in case I could connect with the unstable air.  The powered climb had left me with a glide angle of 8 to get back to the airport, so I decided that I could glide out until the angle became 20.  Experience has shown this to be a good number to use, considering sink and headwinds.  The limit of my range, about 16 miles out took me almost to the first nice looking cloud, but I did not want to take a chance with empty batteries, so I did not dash under it, but headed home instead.

Naturally I fell into heavy sink, and my required L/D soon became 22, but sink is almost always followed by lift, so soon I was climbing. Small clouds started to form under me, and I was surprised to find thermals over the clouds. It seems the air mass from the mountains was moving in my direction. There were several different cloud bases, and one cloud formed around me as I climbed. After topping out I headed back toward the south, and noticed that for the first time in Voghera I could see the ocean clearly. I got within gliding distance to Genoa, and the sun reflecting off the Meditteranean looked nice, the pictures do not do it justice.

By then I was getting cold, so I headed back, but there was an almost solid wall of clouds in my way.  I found a gap, and flew back direct. On approach I found a strong cross wind from the northeast, which is off the trees and very turbulent, but there was no problem landing.

An hour later came a downpour, followed by a double rainbow, as the storm moved away.  Not bad for a day that was cloudless at noon with no sign of soaring weather!
