The flying is good all year round here in Voghera, today the sky filled up with lenticulars, so I decided to have a go at it late in the day. The wind was strong from the north, but the Alps are far enough away for it to be smooth here. The best wave action was downwind, over the Apennines, and I could not risk going that far downwind.  I tried behind some local hills, the wind was already 22 knots at a thousand meters, and I am sure stronger higher.  Very clear air and beautiful autumn colors.
