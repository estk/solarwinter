50 years of flying for the aero club in Motiers Switzerland was celebrated with an air show, showcasing a wide variety of aircraft.

Irena and I first stopped at Mollis, and enjoyed the hospitality of the glider club there.  I flew the SUNSEEKER on the ridge over the airfield, and Irena joined me in a club DG-500.

The day before the show was perfect weather, and all the pilots practiced their routines.  I was asked to make a low pass, so I did. Later I found out that a low pass could not be lower than 50 meters, so the pass for the show was much higher!

Swiss TV was there for an interview, and some friends and relatives came to visit.
