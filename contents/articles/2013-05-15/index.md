Sunseeker II is back in the sky with new battery packs. The first flight since January, and the first from its new base in Voghera, Italy. The flight gave Eric Raymond a chance to clean out some of the bugs that accumulated during the hiatus. A faulty connection to the instrument panel kept him pre-occupied for a good part of the flight. Still, he managed to snap some nice pictures and the flight served as a good area checkout.

Ancient castles and quaint farms decorate the countryside, the Apenine Mountains are not far off, and the snow capped peaks of the Alps sit on the horizon. Not a bad perch for two solar powered airplanes!
