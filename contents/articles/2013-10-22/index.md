The first blades out of the mold look great, no voids and the mold alignment and closure are excellent; we cured them in our solar oven. The finished blades with root fitting weigh only 392 grams, with the CG quite close to the root end. 

The complex teetering and folding hub from John Lynch's shop is now completed and mounted on the airplane. Here we see the first test run of the finished assembly.
