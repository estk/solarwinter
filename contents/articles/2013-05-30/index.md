"I was in the mood to work all day today, getting the Duo ready for test flights later this month, but at 5:30 in the afternoon I noticed it was perfect cloudstreets, so I pulled Sunseeker II out for a flight. The late soaring was excellent, but a huge thunderstorm erupted to the north, and came to Voghera against the wind. I landed about 15 minutes before the rain. It was still sunny, but the sky was quickly turning black."

Later we found out that the storm created a tornado, extremely rare for Italy. The twister ripped through nearby suburbs of Milan overturning lorries and damaging buildings.
