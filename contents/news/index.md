Sunseeker Duo arrived safely at our new facility in Italy. We are in the process of moving the rest of the shop from Solvenia. Once the move is finished, we will be preparing the Duo for its first test flights. The first flights will be short, unpowered flights towed behind a vehicle. Eric Raymond will be the pilot - he feels that he has a better connection to the airplane with the variables of the motor and propellor left out of the equation.
