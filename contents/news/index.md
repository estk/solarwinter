<img class="img-sl" src="/news/solarimpulsebrad.jpg"> 23 years after the first solar-powered airplane crossing of the United States made by Eric Raymond flying Sunseeker I, Solar Impulse has launched its own expedition. Bertrand Piccard took off early this morning from Moffett field in California with Phoenix, Az set as his goal. A fitting first leg, Phoenix was also the first destination for Sunseeker I on its journey across America. Performance can be pursued in many forms and the metric that Solar Impulse is after is duration. Using energy stored both in batteries and in the altitude that is gained during the day, HB-SIA is able to glide and cruise at low power through the night. Though it flies at similar airspeeds as Sunseeker I, HB-SIA is able to plan much longer flights because of its incredible duration. 23 years is a long time in the tech world – batteries, solar cell and materials have all improved, but with structural, aerodynamic, and UV requirements all at odds with each other, designing a solar-powered airplane remains no small challenge. Solar Impulse licensed Solar Flight Inc’s solar-cell integration technology and hired Eric Raymond to oversee HB-SIA’s construction.

As we wish Andre and Bertrand favorable winds on their adventure, we prepare our new airplane, Sunseeker Duo for its maiden flight in Italy.
