While touring the factory of the small Silicon Valley startup Tesla Motors, Eric asked, "What can people do to help?" "Go work for an electric car company." Was the reply from Tesla's founder. Rather than take the advice, Eric found Solar Flight and two months later moved to San Diego to work with E. Raymond. A pilot since age 14, He is the only person other than E. Raymond to have flown both the Edelweiss and the original Sunseeker. Eric is also a member of the US Unlimited Glider Aerobatic Team and a competitor in the Advanced Power category.
